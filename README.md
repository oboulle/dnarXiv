# Overview

The [dnarXiv](https://project.inria.fr/dnarxiv/) project aims to explore various strategies based on this general framework, both on biotechnology and computer science aspects. Three main lines of research are currently being pursued:

1. Biotechnology: DNA synthesis and sequencing. This research axis aims to investigate how enzymatic synthesis and nanopore sequencing technologies can be efficiently exploited for DNA storage. It also aims to identify constraints that need to be considered for efficient coding and security methods.

2. Error correcting codes Here, the goal of is first to develop new error models to capture DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing features, and then to design adapted codes.

3. Security. To avoid limitations and constraints for users, security should be included in the early steps of the development of upcoming technologies. The objectif, here, is to investigate security mechanisms that are highly transparent and flexible for the users. 

These research axes are completed by an experimentation platform allowing to test the different hypotheses envisaged.

Starting date of the project: October 1, 2020
